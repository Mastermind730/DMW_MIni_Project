MiniProject: Investment Analysis
Overview
This project aims to analyze investment preferences and behaviors based on a survey dataset. It explores various factors that influence investment decisions, including gender, age, risk tolerance, investment monitoring frequency, and more. The analysis employs data visualization techniques using the Seaborn and Matplotlib libraries to provide insights into the investment landscape.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project, Finance_data.csv, contains responses from individuals regarding their investment preferences. The key variables in the dataset include:

gender: The gender of the respondent.
age: Age group of the respondent.
Factor: Key factors influencing the respondent's investment decisions.
Purpose: The purpose of their investment.
Duration: Duration of investment.
Invest_Monitor: Frequency of investment monitoring.
Installation
To run this project, ensure you have the following libraries installed:

Pandas
NumPy
Seaborn
Matplotlib
You can install the required libraries using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib
Usage
Clone the repository or download the MiniProject.ipynb file and Finance_data.csv dataset.
Open the Jupyter Notebook (MiniProject.ipynb) in your preferred environment (e.g., Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab).
Run the cells sequentially to load the dataset, perform data cleaning, and generate visualizations.
Code Structure
Data Loading: The dataset is loaded using Pandas, and unnecessary columns are dropped for analysis.

Visualization:

Gender distribution of respondents.
Age distribution of respondents.
Key factors affecting investment decisions.
Risk tolerance by age and gender.
Analysis of investment duration and monitoring frequency.
Conclusions
The visualizations generated in this project help to understand the investment behaviors of respondents based on various demographic and behavioral factors. Key insights include the influence of returns and risk on investment decisions and monitoring habits across different age groups and genders.
